First Project: Create a battery-powered wifi-connected air temperature probe to measure the air temperature in the beer fermenting area. This will inform decisions about what yeasts to use (and therefore what beers to make) and provide data on temperature fluctuations over time that might affect beer quality.

Components:
- ESP32
- TSic 501F temperature IC
- 5v regulator
- 7v lipo
